# Mountain-Car_Reinforcment-learning

A car is on a one-dimensional track, positioned between two “mountains”. The goal is to drive
up the mountain on the right in as few steps as possible; however, the car’s engine is not strong
enough to scale the mountain in a single pass. Therefore, the only way to succeed is to drive
back and forth to build up momentum.

in this project I used Open AI Gym by using Mountain-Car environment
